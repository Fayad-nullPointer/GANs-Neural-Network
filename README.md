# GANs-Neural-Network
ðŸš€ **Exciting Project Announcement!** ðŸš€  I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I delved into the fascinating world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using the Keras framework. My focus was on generating new, realistic images based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 50,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. -
